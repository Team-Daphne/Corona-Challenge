          <p>I am a software developer and experiential product expert with a knack for understanding customer pain points and delivering creative, effective solutions. Drawing on my background as an adventure travel guide, I bring an agile mindset and talent for developing authentic relationships to look beyond what currently exists and articulate (and build) what could be. The week I graduated from college, I decided to take a whitewater raft guiding course, and it changed the trajectory of my life, leading to a decade as an adventure travel guide and a lifelong desire for exploration and learning. During the COVID pandemic of 2020, I’ve embraced a new opportunity to launch my career as a developer, in which I intend to  harness my insatiable curiosity, love of storytelling, and drive for elegant customer solutions. I’m always open to hearing about new opportunities, brainstorming, and swapping adventure stories, and I’d love to hear how I can help you achieve your audacious goals!

          <p>Served in the Military for 5 years as police from there I switched over to intel in the reserve. During that I was a lighting technician. Due to the coronavirus that work came to a halt. I am currently studying at Code Fellows to better myself. It has been a challenging but empowering experience. I see potential in this field. Right now I am taking JavaScript and am going to pursue python to better help me in the cybersecurity realm.

          <p>I am a new software developer currently studying at Code Fellows. I've worked a variety of different jobs, and my experiences have helped me hone my ability to quickly learn to do a new job or pick up a new skill. Most recently, I worked as a surveyor, and started with no experience in a field that usually requires a 2 year technical degree.  I was able to learn on the job very quickly and even help my coworkers learn new software. Seeing how two different programs approach the same tasks will be helpful to me as a developer.  With work slowing because of COVID-19, I decided to jump into software development, which I tried briefly in college and always wanted to come back to.  Software development is appealing to me because it is so diverse and has a lot of opportunity, which means I can constantly learn and try new things. I'm looking to find somewhere that I can contribute to a good team while also learning and continue to grow as a developer and a person.

          <p>I’m a software developer on a new adventure in the world of computer programming. After working in the travel industry for the last couple years, I found myself with an opportunity to come back to a budding interest and shift my focus to a new career where I knew that a challenge was waiting. Although my professional experience spans many industries and job titles, a common theme is program and client management. I’m endlessly curious about people and their culture, inspired by their stories, and motivated by the technological ways those things interact.
